Michelle told her first-grade teacher before trial that her mother made her lie—teacher sent letter to Detective McCormack and ADA O'Dwyer, but this exculpatory evidence was not effectively used at trial. Investigation 17 years later reveals Detective McCormack was having an affair with Audrey starting before the trial, including a Key West trip together, creating massive conflict of interest never disclosed. Derek maintained innocence throughout 17 years of incarceration, writing letters to his children. Adult Michelle recants multiple times, stating clearly her father never raped her. Derek refused plea deal that would have freed him because it required admitting guilt. At retrial, Michelle testifies father is innocent, though aggressive cross-examination by O'Dwyer causes momentary confusion.
