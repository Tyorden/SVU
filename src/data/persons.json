Police/ADA considered leveraging his past to coerce confession. Cleared of murders when real killer (Louise) confesses. Severity 3: formal arrest, public workplace scene, coercive interrogation tactics, though ultimate charges partially stick (Campbell shooting)."

He was actually trying to SAVE Cassie (moving her body to the construction site in a delusional video-game-inspired rescue attempt) after witnessing Dorothy and Jane torture and beat her to death. Glenn is later proven innocent when the true perpetrators (Dorothy and Jane) are identified. His consequence is severity 4: psychotic break requiring hospitalization, life-altering mental health crisis triggered by the accusation and interrogation.

The investigation reveals his inappropriate marriage but clears him of rape. Detectives use degrading language about his relationship with Jessie and his show's content during interrogation."

He was complicit (stayed in car, didn't intervene) but didn't rape or kill Melody. Investigation remained police-only; no evidence of public exposure or workplace/family harm from the accusation. He later commits suicide after being manipulated by Garrett, but this is due to guilt/manipulation, not public exposure from false accusation. Excluded from person_rows because exposure was police_only with no public harm."

He confesses under pressure to accidentally pushing Manette down subway stairs, causing her death, but is proven innocent of the murder/dismemberment he was accused of. The M.E. confirms she died from the fall, and body dismemberment was done post-mortem by Russ Bianco at the morgue. Leon's religious community witnessed his arrest. Detectives used accusatory language and moral condemnation ('she made herself unclean,' 'is that why you killed her') during interrogation. No apology shown."

He became a fugitive, jumping bail on stalking and rape charges. His DNA (hair) was supposedly found on the victim, but forensic analysis proves the hair was telogen (naturally shed) and planted, not pulled out during an attack. Millfield fabricated the case to punish Simon for an incident years earlier where he kissed her sister Carrie, who then had a traumatic flashback to being molested by her own father. Simon's actual conduct was stopping when Carrie said no. The exposure remained within law enforcement - FBI tracked him, but there's no indication of media coverage, workplace notification, or public confrontation. His consequence severity is rated 3 due to being a wanted fugitive with an arrest warrant, even though the public exposure was limited."

However, he is INNOCENT of: (1) Rachel Nauss murder (first victim - actual killer unknown/not revealed), (2) Annie May Lawson murder at Coney Island (killed by Stuckey who planted Harrison's thumbprint), (3) Julia Zimmer's car bomb death (rigged by Stuckey), (4) attempted murder of Judge Donnelly (potassium chloride attack by Stuckey). Harrison suffered massive public exposure through arrest, perp walk, media coverage, citywide manhunt for murders he didn't commit. Tagged as 'partially_involved' because he did commit violence against Zimmer (non-lethal assault), but was innocent of the specific murders attributed to him that drove the public exposure and manhunt."

However, this row documents that detectives conducted an extensive PUBLIC HARASSMENT CAMPAIGN against Harris BEFORE they had legal grounds to arrest him - after the initial case was dismissed. They deliberately exposed him at work, distributed flyers in his neighborhood, followed and taunted him publicly. This is notable as police misconduct even against a guilty person, and demonstrates the tactics that could devastate an innocent person.

Dwight pressured to plead guilty to rape (25 to life) to spare his mother from testifying, but refuses on stand, telling truth: he broke in seeking revenge but could NOT bring himself to rape Catherine. Catherine later admits she lied about rape on grandfather's coaching. Dwight guilty of breaking/entering and assault, innocent of rape. Severity 4: life-altering—public trial, family's deepest trauma weaponized in court, forced to relive witnessing mother's rape, facing life sentence for crime he didn't commit. Mother's rape became public record."

Officer Nelson witnessed the scene but could not see Stabler's hands clearly, creating ambiguity. Hunter made the accusation public in open court during arraignment before Judge Ridenour. This triggered an IAB investigation by Lieutenant Tucker, who reviewed Stabler's 'thick file' of prior complaints. The mother weaponized the accusation, suggesting Stabler had a pattern. The accusation was strategic: Hunter's attorney attempted to use it as leverage ('My client would be amenable to dropping his case if you drop yours'). The charge was ultimately dropped when ADA West allowed Hunter to plead out to his original burglary charges, but Stabler endured significant professional scrutiny and career threat during the investigation. Stabler was prohibited from working the case and subject to a restraining order. The public nature of the accusation in court, combined with the IAB investigation, constitutes material harm even though the allegation was eventually dismissed."

Detectives used accusatory/threatening language during interrogation."

Two rape victims misidentified him from photo arrays (cross-race identification error). His GPS location and parents' inability to confirm exact return times made him a prime suspect. SVU actively investigated him as the West Side rapist. Media covered the case extensively. Celebrity chef Jolene Castille shot and killed him, claiming he was attacking her. He died from his injuries. Later, actual rapist Willie Taylor was caught, and victims recanted their IDs of Mehcad. The episode explicitly states he was innocent and was killed due to racial profiling and mistaken identity. This is the central tragedy of the episode—an innocent teenager murdered based on a false accusation."

Lena then murdered Gene and was convicted of first-degree murder.

However, the rubric asks for 'every person who is accused then later shown/strongly implied to be innocent.' Mavis was never accused of anything—she is a survivor who came forward. This entry documents her PUBLIC EXPOSURE as a sexual assault survivor (not as an accused person). If the rubric strictly excludes victims who were never accused, this row should be removed. However, her testimony became part of the media circus ('startling allegations over the weekend and absolute media saturation'), causing her harm via public exposure of her trauma. She expressed fear of being 'ridiculed' and noted 'I've avoided dealing with this for 18 years.' Her consequence is being publicly identified as a rape survivor in a high-profile trial."

DNA evidence later proved his knife had victim's blood but also Perry and Mia's touch DNA—showing he found it, didn't use it. He actually saved Zoe by staying with her until help arrived. Despite being cleared of the sex crime/assault charges, he violated parole and was sent to psychiatric program (not jail). The arrest was public (officers/cadets present), he was physically harmed (tasered), and coercively interrogated. However, exposure remained mostly within law enforcement context—no media, no workplace (he's homeless), no family confrontation shown. The harm is the arrest itself, tasering, psychological pressure, and coerced confession attempts. Consequence_severity=3 because of arrest, physical force, and interrogation tactics, but no life-altering permanent harm (he gets help, not Attica). Police_apology=partial because Carisi acknowledges Charlie 'saved' Zoe and is 'not paranoid' but frames it as 'you're bat crazy, but...' and doesn't apologize for the wrongful arrest/tasering. This is a clear case of a mentally ill homeless man wrongfully accused, physically and psychologically harmed, then quietly cleared."

    "notes": "Derek Thompson is the central figure of wrongful conviction. He was accused of raping his 6-year-old daughter Michelle in 1998. The accusation originated from his wife Audrey after a marital fight, during which Audrey repeatedly questioned Michelle until the child said what her mother wanted to hear. Michelle told her first-grade teacher before trial that her mother made her lie—teacher sent letter to Detective McCormack and ADA O'Dwyer, but this exculpatory evidence was not effectively used at trial. Investigation 17 years later reveals Detective McCormack was having an affair with Audrey starting before the trial, including a Key West trip together, creating massive conflict of interest never disclosed. Derek maintained innocence throughout 17 years of incarceration, writing letters to his children. Adult Michelle recants multiple times, stating clearly her father never raped her. Derek refused plea deal that would have freed him because it required admitting guilt. At retrial, Michelle testifies father is innocent, though aggressive cross-examination by O'Dwyer causes momentary confusion. Consequences: 17 years in prison, sex offender registry, complete family separation, public stigma as child rapist and incest perpetrator, loss of children's entire childhoods. Severity 4 due to life-altering duration of imprisonment and permanent life damage. Episode ends mid-verdict so ultimate legal outcome unknown, but strong implication throughout is that Derek is innocent of a crime that never occurred."

Only evidence: Yusef's ID (witness later deported) and 'a couple strands of Hector's hair' at restaurant where he worked until 3 weeks prior. Hector's alibi: home with wife Soledad (who backs him up). ADA acknowledges 'no jury's gonna convict based on two strands of hair' and 'Without Yusef, it's meaningless.' Released for insufficient evidence. His consistent denials, lack of forensics, and prosecutors' acknowledgment of weak case strongly imply innocence. Public arrest at workplace, arraignment, media coverage = severity 3. Episode ends with Hector being taken hostage, suggesting he is viewed as wrongly accused by community."

University tribunal found him 'responsible' and suspended him for one year, effective immediately, requiring him to vacate campus by 5pm. He was banned from attending classes. The accusation was public—heard by tribunal panel, parents present, later investigated by NYPD. Mia later admitted to Carisi she lied: she consented to sex but told her roommate Renata it was rape to avoid judgment, then couldn't take it back once the school got involved. Carisi testified at the second trial that 'there was no first rape' and Mia 'lied to the school tribunal.' Consequences were severe and life-altering: (1) one-year suspension from Hudson University, (2) banned from campus/classes, (3) rejected by six other colleges despite high SAT scores, (4) pre-med/neurosurgeon career path destroyed, (5) friends stopped talking to him, (6) widespread social stigma ('scarlet R'). Ethan describes being labeled a rapist regardless of truth, his 'life in polite society is over.' He later committed an actual rape against Mia (the second incident) and was convicted, but the first accusation—the subject of this row—was proven false. Severity 4: career-ending, permanent educational exclusion, profound social destruction."

Defense attorney weaponized his transgender status to attack credibility. Jim described this as putting himself 'in a prison of my own making' and losing 'everything I've ever worked for.'"

She was publicly arrested, perp-walked in front of press, held without bail, and sexually assaulted by inmates in jail. Company was taken over by conspirators during her incarceration. Accusation of assaulting Tisa Chee was completely fabricated - Tisa admits 'It wasn't my idea. It was Vinay. He said it wouldn't get to trial.' Evidence shows Luna never even met with Tisa at retreat. Embezzlement emails were ghostwritten by Bobby Frost who hacked her accounts using information provided by former friend Melanie. Bobby also actually raped Luna (separately), making this a case where the actual rapist participated in falsely accusing his victim of being a rapist."

Police rused her to mother's office for 'emergency' then arrested her there in front of mother. She was indicted by grand jury, faced trial. This represents systemic violation of rape victims. Charges eventually dropped after political pressure and revelation that at least 6 victims' DNA was similarly misused (including 9-year-old male assault victim convicted of carjacking, female sex worker convicted of fraud). Severity = 3 due to arrest, indictment, public family exposure, retraumatization of rape victim, and threat of conviction. Though guilty of the theft, her innocence tag relates to the violation of using rape victim DNA - she is 'innocent' of the process crime/violation of her rights. Episode's core message is about protecting rape victims from DNA misuse."

Later Benson realizes: 'the fear that I saw in Father Alberto's eyes' and 'I think that he sent somebody to threaten Father Alberto the morning that he shot him.'

    "notes": "Father Alberto ran Catholic shelter. Squad suspected him based on witness seeing him with crying woman late at night in his room. When Benson and Gomez arrived to question him, he fled in terror. Church was 'pretty banged up' beyond what ICE raid would cause. During struggle over Gomez's gun in catacombs, Father Alberto said 'I can't' when ordered to drop weapon—both men's hands on gun when it discharged. Father died. Later investigation reveals Gomez (actual killer) sent someone to threaten Father Alberto before the confrontation, causing him to flee. Benson realizes Father was innocent victim threatened by Gomez. Captain acknowledges 'professional courtesy' issue around testing Father's DNA against evidence, implying she later understood he was innocent. Episode strongly implies Father was murdered by Gomez to silence potential witness."

Derek was brought from Bahamas for questioning. His son Atlas, believing Derek was responsible, attacked him with metal baseball bat requiring hospitalization.
