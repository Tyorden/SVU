    "summary": "Gretchen Quinn's death is initially investigated as homicide. Detectives suspect several men including her psychiatrist Dr. Mark Daniels (who had sexual relationship with her) and TV anchor Dallas Warner (former lover). Investigation reveals her psychiatrist's prints at scene but alibi holds. Eventually the squad discovers she was a CSA survivor who wrote her own obituary and died by suicide. Her father Robert Sidarsky molested both Gretchen and her sister Ellen. While Dr. Daniels exploited a vulnerable patient, and Dallas Warner was involved with her, the episode concludes Gretchen took her own life. No one was falsely accused of crimes they didn't commit - the psychiatrist did sleep with his patient (unethical but consensual per transcript), Warner did have an affair, and the father did commit CSA (though outside statute of limitations). This is a case about harm FROM accurate accusations, not false ones."

Tracy Henderson's boyfriend Dennis is initially treated as alibied, but later proven guilty. Travis Hall, a parolee volunteer, is found dead (OD'd before Tracy's murder), clearing him. The key false accusation involves the implicit suspicion of Travis Hall before his body is discovered, though this is minimal. Officer Ridley confesses to 18 murders but explicitly denies killing Tracy Henderson, which proves accurate—he is innocent of that specific murder."

Gloria Palmera (Marchek's ex-girlfriend) initially confessed falsely to protect Louise. Multiple innocents were publicly accused during investigation: Lindsay Branson (Marchek victim's mother), Josh Branson (victim's father), James Campbell (parolee falsely suspected then targeted), and Sam Winfield (Citizen Watch leader)."

He is confronted by detectives at his synagogue and arrested, but is later proven innocent when the medical examiner confirms Manette died from a broken neck in a subway fall (accidental death after Leon pushed her). Her body was then stolen from the morgue and dismembered by Russ Bianco for illegal organ trafficking. Leon's public arrest at his synagogue in front of his religious community constitutes exposure, and he was subject to coercive interrogation tactics."

Both men experience psychosis, paranoia, hallucinations, and suicidal ideation as side effects. Callahan rapes his wife Jamie and later assaults his captain; Myers kills his wife Kendra and attempts suicide. SVU initially investigates Jamie Callahan's rape allegation, but the case evolves into an investigation of the military's knowing administration of a dangerous drug. No innocent persons are falsely accused of sex crimes in this episode—the perpetrators (Callahan and Myers) actually committed the violent acts, though under the influence of military-prescribed medication. The episode focuses on holding the Army/pharmaceutical company accountable rather than wrongful accusation dynamics."

Tierney revealed that his partner Jack Colino actually killed Suzanne when she threatened to expose their bank robberies, and Tierney then killed Colino to save the baby (Sheila). Mollinax's conviction was based solely on motive (prior threats while drunk) and circumstantial evidence. While in prison, Mollinax killed another inmate in self-defense during a race riot, complicating his release. He was ultimately pardoned by the governor on condition of pleading guilty to the prison murder with time served."

Davies was wrongly accused the first time (Lakira's recant implies coercion/error), but this time he's guilty. Subplot: Fin shoots Leon Fuller in self-defense while protecting Leon's son André; Joelle sues Fin for wrongful death. The episode focuses on witness intimidation, defense tactics delaying justice, and the toll on victims. Davies qualifies as previously falsely accused (Lakira recanted, charges dropped) but now guilty of different crime."

    "summary": "This episode is a police procedural focusing on Internal Affairs and grand jury investigation of Sergeant Benson after William Lewis's death. While Benson is accused of potentially killing Lewis (or using excessive force in a prior incident), she is the protagonist/detective being investigated, not a civilian wrongly accused of a sex crime. There are no external false suspects who meet the criteria - no civilians accused of sexual offenses who are later cleared. The episode is about institutional accountability of law enforcement, not wrongful accusation of the public."

Mother Catherine (estranged wife) brings claim amid bitter divorce after Frank's affair with her younger sister Rose. Case heavily contested: defense claims Catherine coaching/revenge; prosecution presents Chelsea's testimony, forensics. Middle sister Mavis reveals Frank raped her at age 13. Frank convicted but flees to France before cross-examination. Ambiguous whether Frank is guilty or Chelsea was coached—transcript supports both interpretations. Maddox exposed publicly via media circus, court proceedings, international press. Mavis (proven victim at 13) exposed when she testifies about her own rape."

However, the judge overturns the verdict, citing Evie's pornography work as making it impossible to determine if her 'no' truly meant 'no.' Hudson University expels Evie for violating code of conduct (appearing in porn), not the rapists. No one is wrongly accused in this episode—the perpetrators are identified correctly from the start. Evie is the victim throughout, facing slut-shaming, victim-blaming, expulsion, and judicial bias, but she is never accused of anything criminal herself (only expelled for a university conduct violation). Daniel Pryor is accused and initially convicted, but the judge's reversal is based on evidentiary reasoning (however flawed), not on Daniel being proven innocent. The episode focuses on institutional failures and systemic victim-blaming rather than false accusations."

He claims he was drugged by an escort (Kim Rollins) who robbed him. Despite evidence he was drugged and exploited, Anton is arrested, publicly perp-walked, charged with rape, and remanded without bail. His career and reputation are destroyed. The escort (Detective Rollins' sister) later offers to testify against him as part of her own plea deal, ensuring his conviction despite his innocence of the rape. The episode demonstrates how a drugged and robbed victim becomes a falsely accused rapist with catastrophic professional and legal consequences."

The detectives dismiss his claims and cite prints, DNA, and victim IDs. However, the suspect's repeated claims of wrongful arrest ('Again'), the lawyer's pointed questions, and the suspect's threat to sue suggest a pattern of false arrests.

The case involves a 'Cherry Pickers Club' where senior boys competed to have sex with virgins. Chris initially lied to police about sexual contact, then admitted to foreplay but denied rape. DNA evidence confirmed sexual contact. The case goes to trial with conflicting accounts: Abby says she told him to stop and slow down but he continued; Chris claims everything was consensual and he thought she was willing. The jury finds him not guilty of attempted rape and forcible touching but guilty of sexual misconduct in the first degree, requiring sex offender registry. Both families are devastated. While Chris faces consequences, he is NOT proven or strongly implied innocent - the jury convicted him of sexual misconduct. Therefore, no person rows are included as this does not meet the 'innocent person harmed by false accusation' criteria."

Jake Sanders, a spin instructor with a gun who stalked Brianna, was initially suspected but had an alibi teaching a spin class during the first rape. No innocent persons were publicly accused, arrested, or harmed by false accusations. The perpetrators are eventually identified through online communications and confessions. Tony Kelly raped Carol Solomon based on a high school rejection that turned out to be a wrong phone number."

While Miller is genuinely guilty of multiple crimes (rape of Nikki Staines, witness intimidation, judicial blackmail), the specific murder conviction is secured through prosecutorial misconduct. Stone admits he fabricated evidence because 'the law's just not good enough' and to protect Olivia and her son from Miller's threats. Stone resigns afterward, acknowledging his ethical violations. This episode presents a moral dilemma: a dangerous criminal is convicted, but through illegal means. However, there are no innocent people harmed by false accusations in this episode - Miller is the only person accused, and while the specific evidence against him was manufactured, the show strongly implies his actual guilt in Lindsay's death and explicitly shows his guilt in other crimes."

The investigation reveals Ed Tucker (IAB) had looked into Rachel's complaint in 2004 but was manipulated by his partner Gary Wald into believing it was a fabricated claim. Gary Wald ultimately confesses on tape (via wire worn by Tucker) to 'tuning her up' (assault) when she threatened to expose their affair. Gary is arrested. Tucker, suffering from terminal brain cancer, commits suicide after helping bring down his former partner. The episode contains NO false suspects - Rachel was the victim, Gary Wald was guilty of assault/rape, and all investigative focus was on confirming historical facts rather than wrongly accusing innocents."

There are no innocent people wrongly accused in this episode - Tori, Jasmine, and G were all involved in the crimes, though Tori and Jasmine were also victims of trafficking. No one is cleared of wrongdoing after being publicly accused."
